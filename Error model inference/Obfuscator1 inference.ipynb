The example sentences that I have presented above were specifically chosen, and the model will not always be able to make corrections of this quality. Given the amount of data that we are working with, this model still struggles. For it to be more useful, it would require far more training data, and additional parameter tuning. This parameter values that I have above worked best for me, but I expect there are even better values that I was not able to find.\n","\n","Thanks for reading!"]}]}
